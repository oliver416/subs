1
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,878
Well Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final
round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?

2
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,238
- We're ready Bob! - Any
particular prize you're hoping for?

3
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,279
Well Hawaii's nice but
Tahiti would be fun too!

4
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:50,536
- Aww anywhere would be great. - Holidays
and digidays, I wish you luck. Here we go.

5
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,565
What is the thin flap of skin that runs from
the base of the penis, to the scrotum?

6
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,246
Oh, oh wait wait, I know this.

7
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:03,961
The... upper vascular hood!

8
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:07,124
I'm sorry but you're
absolutely right!

9
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:13,840
- Let's tell them what they've won.
- Tom and Mary, put on your travel hats

10
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:17,721
because you're going to beautiful
South Park, Colorado.

11
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:20,520
- Where? - That's right.
Just in time for Cow Days,

12
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:25,363
the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival.
Every fall South Park celebrates Cow Days.

13
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:30,118
And you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at
the fabulous Super 7 Hotel on Bernard Road.

14
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:36,004
And enjoy festivities including prizes rides, and of
course the world famous Running of the Cows.

15
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:38,322
Congradulations Tom & Mary.

16
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:42,599
- Well Tom, Mary, you must be very excited.
- What was second prize again?

17
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,959
That's all for now. See you tomorrow on...
"Ooh what the hell is that!"

18
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,160
Shit.

19
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:56,880
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick
off the 14th annual South Park Cow Days!

20
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:01,104
As most of you know, Cow Days
is when we all get together

21
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:04,405
to celebrate and thank
the noble gentle cow.

22
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:08,519
And now the chairman of
Cow Days, Jimbo Kerns!

23
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:14,161
This year is a very special Cow Days because
we are revealing our all new Cow Memorial.

24
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:18,161
Which will live forever in South Park from
this day forth. Release the curtain!

25
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:26,498
This is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever seen.

26
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,799
Now Mary, this is our only
vacation for years.

27
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:32,218
- We have to make the best of it.
- You're right, I'm sorry honey.

28
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,819
We just need to stay positive.

29
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:39,604
Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the
amazing rides and the wonderful games.

30
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,879
Hey come over here kids,
win fabulous prizes.

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Wow dude, check it out. We can
win Terrance and Phillip dolls!

32
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,174
Are those real Terrance and
Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.

33
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:52,675
Yeah they look like cheap ripoffs.

34
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,237
- Sure they're real. They're even
made in Canada. - Really?

35
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:59,238
Yeah look, they're even signed by
Terrance and Phillip themselves.

36
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:02,325
- Dude, that kicks ass! - Oh god damn I
gotta win those. How much to play?

37
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:05,757
- Five dollars for 3 balls.
- Five dollars! Jesus Christ!

38
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:09,766
Dont worry kid, it's easy. You just gotta put
one ball through Jennifer Love Hewit's mouth.

39
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:12,447
- That's easy.
- Ok we got a player!

40
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,398
Guys check it out.

41
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:18,757
- Damn it. - OK son, you still got two balls
to try and get through her yapper.

42
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,003
Take this Jennifer Love Hewit!

43
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:24,438
- You suck Cartman.
- I'd like to see you do better.

44
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,239
Give me that.

45
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,345
- Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
- It's gotta go through her mouth.

46
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:33,746
- But it... - Sorry kid, try
again. Just 5 more dollars.

47
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,758
Come on Cartman,
give me some money.

48
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,559
- Lend me money fat boy!
- I only have 3 dollars left asshole!

49
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,724
Damn it! Come on, I'll try to get
more money from my mom.

50
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,886
Ok everybody, it's time for
the running of the cows.

51
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,599
- Mom, give me some money! - Kyle what
are you doing here? This is very dangerous!

52
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:53,946
I need 17 dollars so we can win
Terrance and Phillip dolls.

53
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:56,747
Kyle get back into the carnival this instant,
you can't be out on the streets.

54
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:00,300
- I will if you give me money.
- OK here!  - Sweet.

55
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:05,477
Ok everybody ok...settle down! I know you're
all anxious to get to the running of the cows,

56
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:08,480
but let me remind you, those
brave sould who have decided

57
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,281
to run against the cows
do so at their own risk.

58
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:15,957
I don't think I have to remind you that 3
people died in last year's running of the cows.

59
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:19,364
Enough said!
Let's rock n roll!!

60
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,767
Everybody ready to run?

61
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:27,322
Release the cows!

62
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:34,005
They're loose!

63
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:56,884
Ok, we got 15 dollars between us.
That means we got 9 balls to throw.

64
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:59,077
I only need one dude,
I only need one.

65
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:04,686
Come one come all. Get in
line for the chamber of farts.

66
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:07,799
- What's that? - Dare you
enter the chamber of farts?

67
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,838
- How much is it?
- Just 3 tickets boys.

68
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:13,403
Dare you enter the
chamber of farts!

69
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:16,917
- Is it like a haunted house or
something? - Sure, it's very scary!

70
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:21,484
Let's see, each ticked is a dollar,
so 3 tickets is like 2.25....

71
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:23,806
Nope, we can't dude. We have to
win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.

72
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:26,507
Aw come one you guys. We'll still
have plenty of money left over.

73
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,405
- You better be right, dude.
- I'm right!

74
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,317
Keep your hands in at all times.

75
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:41,643
So, the chamber of farts
has another victim ay?

76
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:45,396
Don't be afraid, there
aren't any ghouls here.

77
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:47,757
Only farts!

78
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,318
Ah god damn it!

79
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:58,796
- What the hell was that?
- Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!

80
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:04,206
- Alright boys, ride's over. - What? That
was the dumbest ride I've ever seen.

81
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:06,212
Man what the hell kind of
carnival company are you?

82
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,513
I don't know what you guys are talkin
about, that scared the crap out of me.

83
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:09,867
That was a waste of money Cartman.

84
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:14,068
Hey if you guys wanna great ride,
get in this line. It's only 7 tickets.

85
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:17,087
We can't. We're saving our money for the
balls in Jennifer Love Hewit's mouth game.

86
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:21,488
Aw will you relax you pinkeye!
We have plenty of money!

87
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,044
Come on you guys!
It'll be sweet!

88
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:55,086
- This ride better be good.
- Yeah this line is way too long.

89
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,722
- I think we're almost to the end. - We better
be, we've been in line for almost an hour!

90
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:01,202
- Here we go.
- Finally!

91
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:04,239
- Did you enjoy the ride?
- What ride?

92
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:08,042
This was the line ride. A real
life simmulator of a long line.

93
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,364
- You gotta be kidding me.
- That's five tickets thank you very much.

94
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:14,001
- Come see us again soon!
- My ass we will!

95
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:18,279
Well Cartman, this is just my opinion, but
I think the line ride sucked donkey balls!

96
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:19,739
Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.

97
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,340
Would you like to buy a photo of
you boys enjoying the line ride?

98
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,004
- How much?
- Just 3 dollars.

99
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:28,687
- Oh. That's that's pretty sweet.
- You dumbass Cartman!

100
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:31,196
- What. This is cool!
- No it's not cool! - That's cool!

101
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,922
- Can I help you boys? - We're gonna try to
win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.

102
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:39,006
- Ok, 5 dollars for 3 balls.
- How much do we have left Cartman?

103
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:42,403
- How much do we have left
Cartman? - Uh... 3 dollars.

104
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,749
What? You said we have
plenty of money Cartman!

105
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,350
Yeah but I didn't take it to
account that I suck at math.

106
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:49,796
You son of a bitch!!!

107
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:56,483
Well Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any
money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.

108
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:00,646
- Well I'm sorry! - Sorry's not good enough!
What are you gonna do about it?

109
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,903
Hey, I bet Kenny has some
food stamps on him! - What, these?

110
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:07,444
- Sir, will you take food stamps for 3 balls?
- Sure as long as they're good.

111
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,842
Give em your food stamps Kenny.

112
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,480
Come on dude!
I can do it! I'm sure!

113
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:14,481
I'm gonna die without fucking food stamps! I
have nothing to eat without any food stamps!

114
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,724
Damn it Kenny! Don't be such a food stamphog.
Share with the rest of your friends.

115
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,640
Ok here we go.

116
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,645
- Hey! That was right on target!
- Sorry kid, try again.

117
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:30,242
- That does it! Shenanigans!
Shenanigans!!! - What are you doing?

118
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,757
- I'm declaring Shenanigans on you.
This game is rigged. - Shenanigans?

119
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,092
- What's all the hoo-hah?
- Officer Barbrady,

120
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:38,193
I wanna declare Shenanigans
on this carnival operator.

121
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:41,438
- Why? - This game is fixed. The balls are
bigger than Jennifer Love Hewit's mouth!

122
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:45,606
If that is true, then your
declaration of Shenanigans is just.

123
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,889
What do you have to
say Carnival operator?

124
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,000
Look the kid was really close, he still has
another ball left. Just try again son.

125
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:54,918
Here you go.

126
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,719
- There you see we have a winnah!
- It worked!

127
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:02,467
Yes, man you can't just go declaring
shenanigans on innocent people,

128
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:05,068
that's how wars get started!
- Sorry Officer Buttbaby.

129
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,964
- Barbrady!
- Oh I'm sorry what did I say?

130
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:09,396
You said buttbaby.

131
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:15,599
Ok kids you won. You get to pick between the
Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi toothpick.

132
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:17,836
No dude, I want the Terrance
and Phillip dolls up there.

133
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:20,737
Oh no no no. You gotta win
7 times to earn those.

134
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:25,244
You win 7 Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can
trade em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.

135
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,826
You dirty son of a bitch! You
never told us we had to win....

136
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,227
Step on up! Just 5 dollars to play!

137
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,246
Damn it I have to have those dolls!

138
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,047
It's hopeless we're never gonna
have enough money to win.

139
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:37,602
Wait a minute, I got it.
The bullriding contest.

140
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,195
Cartman could ride a bull and
try to win 5000 dollars.

141
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:46,566
Think about it dude. 5000 dollars. That's
1000 set of balls, that's 3000 balls!

142
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,241
We'd HAVE to win
enough to get the dolls!

143
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:50,142
What the hell makes you
think Cartman rides a bull?

144
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,597
Because you spent all of our money
on those stupid rides fatass!

145
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,893
And either you're getting on a bull or
I'm gonna break your fucking head open!

146
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,394
Ok... I'll get on a bull.

147
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,519
Alright, now come on
you have to practice!

148
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,922
- He really wants those dolls.
- I guess. Damn!

149
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:11,963
- That ride wasn't very good. - Now mary you
promised me we'd try to have a good time.

150
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,523
You're right, I'm sorry honey.
I'll try and have a good time.

151
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,293
Alright, this mechanical bull is gonna help
you practice for the real thing Cartman.

152
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:40,494
Hey this is sweet.

153
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:44,719
- You gotta try and stay on for 10 seconds ok,
Cartman? - I'll try, 10 seconds is a long time.

154
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:47,520
We'll start on the slowest setting
and work our way up. Ready? Go!

155
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,486
Son...of..a...bitch.

156
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:55,201
- How long was that?
- That wasn't quite 10 seconds.

157
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:58,032
Damn it. That wasn't 10 seconds Cartman,
you have to do better than that.

158
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,133
You guys...
seriously... my back...

159
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,033
Get back on fatass,
you have to practice!

160
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,774
Seriously... help...

161
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:07,237
screw you guys...
hate you guys...

162
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,756
- What'd you say Cartman?
- Hate you guys....

163
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:13,197
- I think he said he wants to practice
on a real bull. - ...hate you guys...

164
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:33,638
Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't
much for ridin anymore, but he's all I got.

165
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:37,965
Well he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some
practice with a real bull. - Well have fun boys.

166
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,884
- Ok Cartman, you ready?
- No...

167
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,043
Open the gates!

168
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:48,605
Hey hey, get down.
This is my kind of bull ride.

169
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:52,606
- That bull sucks, he's not even bucking
or anything. - Ooh this is sweet.

170
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:54,800
- What are you gonna do? - Hit the
bull in the balls with a snowball.

171
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,163
Oh yeah that's a good idea!

172
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:01,245
- That's better.
- Hold on, Cartman.

173
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,286
Seriuosly you guys! Seriuosly,
stop this crazy thing! Motherf...

174
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,839
Get up Cartman, you're still
not staying on long enough.

175
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,923
Come on Cartman.

176
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,724
Oh my god!
They killed Cartman!

177
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,323
No we didn't kill him!
He's still breathing.

178
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:18,960
Get up!

179
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,485
Get up!!

180
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:26,595
You ok dude?

181
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,763
Ca..cartman...hell..loo....

182
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:32,245
Dude, I think we broke him.

183
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:38,206
Boys I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered
head trauma. - What's the matter with him?

184
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:42,240
Apparently he thinks he's a
Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.

185
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:45,036
- But can he still ride a bull?
- What?

186
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:46,926
We need him to win the
bullriding contest so we can get

187
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:48,127
Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Can he still do it?

188
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:52,479
- No boys, you need to take him home
and let him get plenty of sleep. - Damn it!

189
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,199
Cartman, Cartman,
can you hear me?

190
00:12:56,156 --> 00:13:00,037
- Shirley bonsier! - What?
- Oh yong shantar yo mother.

191
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,438
- Oh he's fine, dude.
- You think?

192
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,238
Yeah dude, let's get
his ass to the rodeo.

193
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:10,643
Alright damn it! We are
not going to stand for this.

194
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:15,795
Now whoever stole our Golden Cow
Memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!

195
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:23,953
Allright. Ok, whoever took the
sacred cow just please return it

196
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:25,871
and there'll be no questions asked.

197
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,645
Wait a minute, you folks
from outta town.

198
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:33,546
You're the only ones with the reason
to take our beloved cow memorial.

199
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,077
Where are we going to put a
60 foot tall statue of a cow?

200
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:42,076
- I think maybe you'll answer that
downtown, tourists. - Oh my god!

201
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:47,764
- How's he doing? - He still thinks
he's a Vietnamese prostitute.

202
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:53,164
- You think he can ride the bull?
- Yeah I think so.  - Cool!

203
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:56,882
Hora...

204
00:13:57,007 --> 00:14:00,317
Hora... sojuboy... me so horny.
Me love you long time.

205
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,680
- No way kid! You're grossing me out!
- Huro saki saki!!

206
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:07,320
Beat it kid! Come on honey.

207
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,519
Come one, come all. Chamber of
Farts has been fixed and reopened!

208
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:14,799
- Geezes dude.
- Hey, where's Cartman?

209
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,700
- Oh hell.
- I don't know where he is.

210
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,999
Kenny you go find Cartman, we have
to go sign him up for the bull ride.

211
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:27,164
- It's so cold here. - Where is
that Sherriff? We need water!

212
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:31,565
- Oh well let's try to make the best of it Mary.
- You're right, we're not being positive.

213
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:36,158
- At least we get some time alone.
- Yeah and at least we've got our health.

214
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,523
- I tell you Mitchell, I ain't ever seen
nothing like it. - Where are they again?

215
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,922
Just right up over this ridge.

216
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,707
That's what they've been doing
all morning. Sittin there and mooing.

217
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,008
And more cows
come all the time.

218
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:59,051
Well I ain't never seen this before
it neither. But I know one thing,

219
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,039
when cows start gettin together it can't be good.
They might start forming a cult! - Cow cult.

220
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:12,165
Welcome to the Annual
Bull Riding Rodeo!

221
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,917
Once again the Bull Riding event,
grand prize 5000 dollars!

222
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,700
Kenny, where
the hell is Cartman?

223
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:23,545
- I dunno! I couldn't find him!
- He's up in like 20 minutes!

224
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,759
There he is!

225
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,843
Suki suki! Five dolla!

226
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,966
Here they are just
like we told you.

227
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:46,319
Ok that's enough of that.
You cows need to disperse!

228
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:51,605
Alright? Bad cows!
You hear me? BAD COWS!!!

229
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:54,002
Alright Ned, you're gonna
have to bust out the whip.

230
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:58,244
Hya. Get along little doggies.

231
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,805
Bad cows... stay...

232
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,478
Holy smokes! Play dead Ned!

233
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:12,361
- I reckon we should get some help.
- I reckon.

234
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:14,349
Don't be nervous Cartman,
this is gonna be cake.

235
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,050
Yeah, then those Terrance
and Phillip dolls will be ours.

236
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,200
- Suki suki aight?
- Opers number 24, Jack McMack!

237
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:24,087
3,2,1!

238
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,204
Ooh. That's gonna cost
him a point deduction.

239
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:38,761
- Up next #14, Ming Li! - 8 Dolla,
8dolla! You give me 8 dolla socia boy!

240
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:42,084
- Here we go!  - Dude, I'm having second
thoughts about this. - What do you mean?

241
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:44,185
I'm starting to think that maybe
it's wrong to put someone

242
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,586
who thinks they're a Vietnamese
prostitute on a bull.

243
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,444
Let her go!

244
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,406
Hang on Cartman!

245
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:55,901
Whoa, and this Vietnamese
prostitute can really ride a bull!

246
00:16:55,902 --> 00:16:58,902
I guess she's had a lot of
practice if you know what I mean.

247
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:03,043
Ahhh! Ten dolla!
10 dolla socia boy!

248
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:07,683
- She's setting a new world record!
- Ming Li Ming Li! Ming Li!

249
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:14,277
- Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
- Go help him Kenny!

250
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:18,078
Uh uh! I know what's
gonna happen alright!

251
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,806
- Oh my god they killed Kenny!
- You bastards!

252
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:26,045
And this brave little whore from the East,
has really put on a show for us today!

253
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,637
The winner of the
bullriding contest, Ming Li!

254
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,246
Ooh suki suki?
Only ten dolla.

255
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:33,555
We did it dude, we did it!

256
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:40,245
Freeze cows!

257
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:45,395
The game is over! You will now
return to your respective towns!

258
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:49,315
Ya hear that cows? You're
surrounded! There's no way out!

259
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:55,363
You will now all march in an ordely
fashion, into this trailer! Now Move!!!

260
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:05,998
Hey where is she going? That's
the wrong way you stupid cow!

261
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:09,879
Oh dear Jesus no!

262
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,236
They're killing themselves!

263
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:20,278
Stop please!

264
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,519
Can't we do anything???

265
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:28,277
Oh god the humanity Ned!
The humanity!

266
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,320
This is the first cow mass suicide
I've seen in... at least 8 months.

267
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,082
- Oh you boys are back again huh? - Yeah,
and we have 5000 dollars this time.

268
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,675
How many balls does that get us?

269
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:47,316
Uh uh I'll tell you what boys. I'm gonna
be really nice and just trade you

270
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:49,417
the 5000 for the
Terrance and Phillip dolls.

271
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,916
- You will? - Wow, why'd you
get so cool all of a sudden?

272
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,797
We did it! You see Cartman? You
won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!

273
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:00,515
- What should we do with them?
- We should...

274
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,760
- Dude these dolls are cheap ripoffs!
- After all that?

275
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:07,845
Shenanigans! Shenanigans!!!!
SHENANIGANS!!!!!!

276
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:12,245
- What's all this? - Officer Barbrady, I would
like to reinstate my previous shenanigans!

277
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:15,600
- This whole carnival is a ripoff!!
- You know, uh excuse me, but I agree.

278
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,001
These rides are really stupid.

279
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:20,204
- Chamber of farts isn't scary at all.
- Yeah and the food is terrible!

280
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,682
Hey it's just a stupid
rodeo, what do you expect?

281
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:27,333
Ok ok, let's calm down.
People of South Park,

282
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,634
do you declare shenanigans
on the carnival people?

283
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:34,163
Ok carnival people. Do you accept
this decree of shenanigans?

284
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,438
What the hell are you talkin about?
This whole town is screwy.

285
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:42,560
Well that settles it. Everybody
grab a broom! It's Shenanigans!!!

286
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:53,000
You found it!
You found the memorial!

287
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:57,484
- And the cows? Are they all back too?
- They're dead mayor! They're all dead!

288
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:59,837
- What?!?
- Oh it was awful!

289
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:04,995
Cow after cow taking its own life,
and we could do nothing to stop them!

290
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:09,200
Well perhaps one day cows will learn
that cults are never a good thing.

291
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,239
I hope so mayor,
I hope so.

292
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:15,359
I need a cold beer and a burger.

293
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,000
What's all the ruckus over there?

294
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:22,638
- Sounds like somebody declared shenanigans.
- Oh hell I have to run home and get my broom!

295
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:27,916
Ok carnival people,
in the jail with....ooh?

296
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:32,360
Hey, aren't those the people
we thought took the wooden cow?

297
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:37,560
- Didn't we ever release them?
- Well I forgot all about them.  - Uh me too.

298
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:41,839
Oh my god....officer Barbrady, uh you
never had Tom and Mary in this cell.

299
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:45,357
- I didn't? - No! No, in fact they
never came to South Park.

300
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:48,957
- We've never heard of them.
- Ooh. Gee I feel a lot better then.

301
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:52,636
Although I could've sworn that I have heard of
them and they starved to death in my prison.

302
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:57,561
- Say Terrance, let's look for treasure.
- Oh good idea Phillip, lets look for treasure!

303
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:00,485
- What are you guys doing?
- Oh hey Cartman. How are you feeling?

304
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:03,519
Oh pretty good except I had
the weirdest dream last night.

305
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:07,720
- Really? What about? - Well, I dreamt
that I was a poor vietnamese girl,

306
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,690
and then you guys made
me ride a big scary bull.

307
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:12,991
And then Leonardo DeCarprio gave
me a spankin for several hours.

308
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:18,645
- Heey, how did you guys win all those
Terrance and Phillip dolls? - Oh... nowhere.

309
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:22,965
- Wait a minute! You guys DID make me ride
that bull! - No! Cartman, that was just a dream!

310
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:26,922
Bye Ming Li. Thanks again!

311
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:32,842
Son of a bitch!
